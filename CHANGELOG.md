## Unreleased

### Added

- Made preflight title and R2C logo link to the browser extension's GitHub repo and the R2C website respectively
- Made Preflight similar to a PR status check, showing ‚úÖ , ‚ö†Ô∏è, or ‚ùå based on this criteria [link:criteria write-up when available]
- Promoted our permissions experiment to a "permanent" feature that is always on
- When viewing a file in GitHub, we now mark lines that are related to a permission as well as issues
- Added toggle for including @types definitions in for typescript projects with types defined in DefinitelyTyped

## [1.14.0] - 2018-11-27

### Added

- Added support for R2C to flag projects as malicious / do not use (e.g. [event-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream))

### Fixed

- Made "used by" data more complete - we now surface more major tech companies

## [1.13.3] - 2018-11-14

### Fixed

- Fixed some centering and stray markup issues with the missing data message
- Fixed an issue where the language breakdown graphic disappears after navigation (#182)

### Changed

- Updated the permissions experiment to include permissions beyond "Network Access"

### Added

- Added logging for checklist items to better understand how users interact with surfaced data

## [1.13.0] - 2018-11-05

### Added

- We now publish an alpha version of the product for those we really want to be early adopters of features
- You can now hide the "unsupported project" banner from always appearing (#122) (thanks @jruhland for the feedback!)
- There is also a switch for toggling between showing the "unsupported project" banner in the popup settings! (#165)

### Changed

- Clarified missing data and unsupported messages
- The popup now shows the feedback page by default
- We've made the Settings page easier to find

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where we failed to display error/unsupported when no information for the repository is available (#157)
- Fixed missing data handling so we display a helpful message instead of an error

### Removed

- Disabled the commenting feature while we look into better ways for people to share their knowledge and opinion about projects
- Streamlined the popup by removing activity feed and inbox pages left over from earlier versions of the extension

## [1.12.0] - 2018-10-30

### Added

- We show the "Current Commit" badge when viewing the master branch if we've analyzed the latest commit (previously you had to be looking at the specific commit, not master) (#147)
- You can now discover packages frequently used alongside the package you're currently viewing
- Added a star next to packages in the package chooser that are used by prominent orgs

### Changed

- Updated the language we use for unsupported projects to more clearly explain our npm focus (thanks @deifactor for the feedback!)

- We now fail more gracefully depending on the information we have about a project

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where we incorrectly reported no package.json install scripts for some projects
- Fixed us always displaying `[object Object]` in error message details (#134)

### Removed

## [1.11.0] - 2018-10-16

### Changed

- When you click on the issues badge next to a file or folder, you can now go directly to the individual files and issues by clicking on them. (#102)

- The Preflight checklist now has a header instead of a footer.
- We've moved information about how recently Preflight data was updated to the top of the checklist and details pane.

- Fixed accidentally showing the "Issues on other commit" warning banner even if there weren't any issues in the current file (#105)

- Fixed parsing of GitHub URLs so a trailing slash doesn't break things

### Removed

- Removed Top 10 tab from popup because voting on projects was removed in earlier versions

### Fixed

- Fixed comment box overflowing containing twist

## [1.8.0] - 2018-09-14

### Added

- New experiment: Preflight checklist
  - When looking at a supported repository, we'll show:
    - a list of criteria that you might be interested in when evaluating the project for security and quality
    - an easy way to install the most used package for the repo you're looking at
  - Please let us know if you find these criteria useful, or if you have suggestions and feedback on how to make them better.
- New experiment: Preflight manifest
  - On a supported repository, we'll start to surface details about Preflight criteria in the sidebar.
  - This experiment is even earlier than usual, so expect it to evolve substantially over the coming days.
  - As always, let us know if there's additional info or a particular way to see this info that you'd be interested in.

### Changed

- After chatting with people, we're trying out a "Flag this project for review" in lieu of upvote/downvote buttons.

### Changed

- Added an experiment panel in the extension: click the R2C extension icon in the top right corner and then the icon in the tab bar

## [1.5.0] - 2018-08-28

### Added

- Added repository information to the extension, including:
  - A work-in-progress score that sums up the properties of the project. Higher scores imply a higher quality project.
  - Permissions or capabilities that we've detected in the project. You can use this list to understand what the project does, and whether or not the project has permissions or capabilities that you expect it to have.
  - If the project is published to NPM, we show the most-used published package and the command to easily install the package.
- Added a comment count next to the comment bubbles
- Instrumented various extension interactions with remote analytics so we can better understand how people use the extension and develop our future product experiments. We did not instrument any part of the native GitHub user interface and do not collect any sensitive information. See [our stance on privacy](./PRIVACY.md) for more info.

### Changed

- Changed the comment bubbles from single bubble to double bubble for aesthetics

## [1.4.0] - 2018-08-22
