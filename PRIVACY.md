# Privacy

This document is a work-in-progress. If you have feedback or concerns about topics concerning privacy, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/preflight-extension/issues/new).

We plan to maintain transparency about our use of information and our stance on privacy, and we plan to provide tools in the future that enable you to manage our use and storage of your data.

## Data usage

This extension requests access to read and modify www.github.com for the purposes of extending and augmenting GitHub's repo page. We do not store any sensitive identifying information or credentials on our servers.

### Third party services

We use the Intercom messenger to make it easy to chat with us without writing an email or registering for another service. The Intercom Messenger is only initialized when you open the Feedback tab in the extension, and it is immediately removed when you navigate away from the Feedback tab or close the extension popup.

## Telemetry

This extension is in beta and contains a number of product experiments, so we collect telemetry from the extension to understand use and decide what to work on next. This telemetry contains a minimal amount of identifying information (your GitHub username, client IP address, and a unique installation ID that is local to your browser). If you have concerns about your privacy or how we use telemetry, please let us know on GitHub.
