# Preflight Beta - Your GitHub Copilot ðŸ›«

Preflight is a beta browser extension that makes it fast and simple for you to make decisions about using npm packages. We surface data and a rubric for their quality and security, and if anything merits your attention, we alert you. You shouldn't have to needlessly read 3rd-party code and instead focus on the stuff that matters, like writing that killer new feature and shipping product.

If any of our checks come back with concerning answers we'll notify you through a modified GitHub UI, letting you investigate and focus on the stuff that's abnormal about a project.

To install the extension, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emaioeinhnifhcmlihcbooknbpjdbllb) or our [Mozilla Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/r2c-beta/).

If you have questions, feedback, or ideas, please reach out to us at support@ret2.co.
